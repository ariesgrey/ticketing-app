# Ticketing Application

I created this app following a [freeCodeCamp.org tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-next-js-tailwind-css-and-mongodb-to-build-a-ticketing-application/).

This Ticketing App is a centralized tool for developers to manage tasks, issues, and projects efficiently. It has two pages - a Dashboard page and a Ticket Form page - and has established CRUD functionality connected to a MongoDB database.

This was my first time using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB + Mongoose. I found the tutorial simple to follow, and the tools useful and easy to understand with my established knowledge of React, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. I look forward to utilizing them in my own future project.
